1.How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
38

2. What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first 10: the initializer, also is used to determine x point of the line in the body loop.
The second 10: is used for the condition to check if the x < 390.
The Third 10: is used for increment to change the loop variable, and it determines the distance between two x points.

1. How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
6 times.

2. What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
One way of increasing the spacing between rings is increasing the number inside increment(i = i + 10
).
Another way is changing number in ellipse’s function ” (x.length - 6*i)”.

3. How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
Add frameRate function can make the ellipse trail longer.
